# webscapes

a barebones soundscape listener for the browser. doesn't come with any audio assets - get some from your copy of HL2 or [use my demo](https://dbd.yesnt.ga/fog/webscapes/)

## in this repo

* a Python script to parse the soundscape scripts into json. requires [vdf](https://github.com/ValvePython/vdf)
* js script that has the player code
* html page to test the player

im gonna document and improve this eventually
