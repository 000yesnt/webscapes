# webscapes - soundscape to json parser

here we have

* the python script
* the default "source" soundscape - "soundscapes_all.txt". it has hl2 and portal 1 soundscapes in it
* the og_scapes folder, with the original hl2 soundscape scripts if you need them for some reason

# ⚠️ if you're making your own source .txt, make sure to put *all* the required soundscapes in the same file, else the script won't be able to resolve the "playsoundscape" options!

once you do that, you can just edit the script to load that file. it's at the top you'll find it instantly
